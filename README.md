# EPICORE Centre Software Developer Job Application

## Robert Adie | Portfolio Project

## Project Outline

This portfolio project outlines one possible version of an information system that could be used to support an epidemiologic study conducted in collaboration with the EPICORE Centre. The research study used as the business case for this system is ["The Effectiveness of Pharmacist Intervention on Cardiovascular Risk: The Multicenter Randomized Controlled RxEACH Trial"](https://www.onlinejacc.org/content/67/24/2846) by Ross T. Tsuyuki, Yazid N. Al Hamarneh, Charlotte A. Jones, and Brenda R. Hemmelgarn.

Included in this project are the following:

1. A description of the database schema, including a ERD, Data Dictionary, DDL script for building the database, and script for inserting test data.

2. A Web API project built in .NET Framework to allow for several basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) use cases; included in this section are code examples and screenshots of the API functionality being tested using Postman.

## Project Limitations

1. Due to time constraints, the development of the database was prioritized, followed by the server-side API that would be used to make alterations to the database while enforcing business logic. A client-side portion of the application was desired but deemed less of a priority due to the job description.

2. In the patient assessment table, many of the measurements only have units specified in the data dictionary notes. If multiple measurement types were to be used it would be advisable to abstract all values (for example, waist circumference, height, weight, etc.) into their own tables that would allow for heigh in cm or height in inches to be associated with a record.
