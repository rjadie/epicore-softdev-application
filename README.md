# EPICORE Centre Software Developer Job Application

## Robert Adie | Portfolio Project

## Project Outline

This portfolio project outlines one possible version of an information system that could be used to support an epidemiologic study conducted in collaboration with the EPICORE Centre. The research study used as the business case for this system is ["The Effectiveness of Pharmacist Intervention on Cardiovascular Risk: The Multicenter Randomized Controlled RxEACH Trial"](https://www.onlinejacc.org/content/67/24/2846) by Ross T. Tsuyuki, Yazid N. Al Hamarneh, Charlotte A. Jones, and Brenda R. Hemmelgarn.

Included in this project are the following sections:

1. A description of the database schema, including a ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram), Data Dictionary, and DDL (Data Definition Language) script for building the database and inserting test data.

2. A RESTful (Representational State Transfer) API project built with .NET Framework to allow for several basic CRUD (primarily Create & Read) use cases; included in this section are code excerpts and examples of successful responses to API calls. All testing is done using the Postman API testing application.

3. A brief discussion of the project.

### Database Scripts

The Data Definition Language (DDL) SQL script related to implementing the aforementioned schema (and inputting static test data based upon it) can be found in the db-files folder of the repository.

## RESTful API Service

### Project Structure

The API application can be found in the api-project folder. It contains a Visual Studio 2019 solution file with 3 embedded projects: a .NET Framework Web API project called WebAPI, a class library containing data objects used throughout the project called WebAPI.Model, and a class library containing data access-related objects called WebAPI.DataAccess.

Firstly, the WebAPI project contains the controller classes that set the API URL parameters and enforce business logic. Secondly, the WebAPI.Model project contains an APIResponse object that is used to return custom API response parameters with each API call, a Models folder with all database model classes (derived from the database using Entity Framework), and a ViewModels folder with all custom data objects (including POCOs and DTOs) used within the API calls themselves. Finally, the WebAPI.DataAccess project contains the DAL (Data Access Layer) folder with a context class (necessary to make calls to the database), the Handlers folder with a class to act as an intermediary between the controller and database operations, and the DBTasks class, which is responsible for interacting with the database directly through LINQ queries.

The project structure can be summarized as follows:
- Controller classes make calls to handler methods; 
- Handler methods make calls to DBTasks methods; and
- DBTasks methods interact with the database.

The following will show some excerpts of the code used to interact with the database, with an emphasis on Create and Read (i.e., Post and Get) methods to allow for brevity.

### Project Excerpt: Create (Post)

- The create method is called as an asynchronous task to optimize software performance.
- There is 1 read method (GetPatientParams()) that returns the parameters necessary for a user to create a Patient record (all of the pharmacist and ethnicity information to fill out the relevant drop down menus).
- The following controller method is called by the API:

        APIResponse<PostResponseVM> response = new APIResponse<PostResponseVM>();

        PatientsHandler handler = new PatientsHandler();
        response = await handler.AddPatient(newPatient);

        return Ok(response);

- The following is the handler method called by the controller:

        APIResponse<PostResponseVM> response = new APIResponse<PostResponseVM>();
        try
        {
            DBTasks tasks = new DBTasks();
            response = await tasks.AddPatient(newPatient);
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            response.Messages.Add(new Message()
            {
                MessageCode = "AP001",
                MessageSeverity = MessageSeverity.Error,
                MessageText = ex.InnerException.Message
            });
        }

        return response;

- Finally, the following is the DBTasks method called by the handler (including LINQ queries):

        APIResponse<PostResponseVM> response = new APIResponse<PostResponseVM>();

        using (var context = new EPPContext())
        {
            Patient patientToAdd = new Patient();

            var validPharmIds = (from pharms in context.Pharmacists
                                    select pharms.PharmacistID).ToList();

            if (!validPharmIds.Contains(newPatient.PharmacistID))
            {
                response.Messages.Add(new Message()
                {
                    MessageCode = "AP001",
                    MessageSeverity = MessageSeverity.Error,
                    MessageText = "Please submit a valid pharmacist id to add a patient."
                });
            }
            else
            {
                patientToAdd.PharmacistID = newPatient.PharmacistID;
            }

            var validEthnicityIds = (from ethns in context.EthnicityTypes
                                        select ethns.EthnicityTypeID).ToList();

            if (!validEthnicityIds.Contains(newPatient.EthnicityTypeID))
            {
                response.Messages.Add(new Message()
                {
                    MessageCode = "AP002",
                    MessageSeverity = MessageSeverity.Error,
                    MessageText = "Please submit a valid ethnicity id to add a patient."
                });
            }
            else
            {
                patientToAdd.EthnicityTypeID = newPatient.EthnicityTypeID;
            }

            if (response.Messages.Count() == 0)
            {
                patientToAdd.FirstName = newPatient.FirstName;
                patientToAdd.LastName = newPatient.LastName;
                patientToAdd.Age = newPatient.Age;
                patientToAdd.Gender = newPatient.Gender;
                patientToAdd.PhysicianIsInformed = newPatient.PhysicianIsInformed;

                context.Patients.Add(newPatient);
                await context.SaveChangesAsync();

                PostResponseVM responseObj = new PostResponseVM
                {
                    NewRecordId = newPatient.PatientID,
                    ResponseMessage = "Patient added successfully."
                };

                response.Response = responseObj;
            }
            
        }

        return response;

- To create a record, submit the following URL and JSON data (within the request body) respectively:

        http://localhost:51368/api/addpatient

        {
            "PharmacistID": "1",
            "EthnicityTypeID": "1",
            "FirstName": "Bill",
            "LastName": "Patient",
            "Age": "67",
            "Gender": "Male",
            "PhysicianIsInformed": "true"
        }

- If successful, the following custom JSON object will be returned (derived from the APIResponse class):

        {
            "Messages": [],
            "ApiVersionNumber": "1.0.0.0",
            "Response": {
                "NewRecordId": 9,
                "ResponseMessage": "Patient added successfully."
            },
            "IsSuccess": true
        }

### Project Excerpt: Read (Get)

- This read operation returns a List\<T\> where T is a custom PatientVM object.
- The Get controller class contains the following:

        APIResponse<List<PatientVM>> response = new APIResponse<List<PatientVM>>();
            
        PatientsHandler handler = new PatientsHandler();
        response = handler.GetPatients();

        return Ok(response);

- The handler method called above contains the following:

        APIResponse<List<PatientVM>> response = new APIResponse<List<PatientVM>>();
        try
        {
            DBTasks tasks = new DBTasks();
            response = tasks.GetPatients();
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            response.Messages.Add(new Message()
            {
                MessageCode = "GP001",
                MessageSeverity = MessageSeverity.Error,
                MessageText = ex.InnerException.Message
            });
        }

        return response;

- And finally, the DBTasks method called above contains the following:

        APIResponse<List<PatientVM>> response = new APIResponse<List<PatientVM>>();
        using (var context = new EPPContext())
        {
            var patients = (from patient in context.Patients
                            select new PatientVM
                            {
                                FirstName = patient.FirstName,
                                LastName = patient.LastName,
                                Age = patient.Age,
                                Gender = patient.Gender,
                                PhysicianIsInformed = patient.PhysicianIsInformed,
                                Ethnicity = (from ethnicity in context.EthnicityTypes
                                            where ethnicity.EthnicityTypeID == patient.EthnicityTypeID
                                            select ethnicity.EthnicityTypeDescription).FirstOrDefault(),
                                Pharmacist = (from pharmacist in context.Pharmacists
                                                where pharmacist.PharmacistID == patient.PharmacistID
                                                select pharmacist.LastName + ", " + pharmacist.FirstName).FirstOrDefault()
                            }).ToList();

            if (patients == null || patients.Count() == 0)
            {
                response.Messages.Add(new Message()
                {
                    MessageCode = "GP001",
                    MessageSeverity = MessageSeverity.Warning,
                    MessageText = "Sorry, there are no patients to display."
                });
            }
            else
            {
                response.Response = patients;
            }
        }

        return response;

- To submit the request, enter the following URL:

        http://localhost:51368/api/getpatients

- If successful, the following JSON data will be returned (again, from the custom APIResponse object):

        {
            "Messages": [],
            "ApiVersionNumber": "1.0.0.0",

## Project Limitations

1. Due to time constraints, a client-facing application and all requisite Update and Delete (Put and Delete) methods were ommitted. I emphasized the Get, Post, and database schema/DDL portions of the project due to their relative importance, as well as their greater relevance to the job description.

2. In the patient assessment table, many of the measurements only have units specified in the data dictionary notes. If multiple measurement types were to be used, it would be advisable to abstract all values (for example, waist circumference, height, weight, etc.) into their own tables so as to allow for metric and US Customary variance (e.g., height in cm or inches).

## Conclusions

I'm extremely excited by the important work the EPICORE Centre is doing, both to help enable pharmacists to play a more pronounced role in treating chronic disease and doing vital pharmaceutical research more broadly. I would love to be a part of your work in any way that I can and I really appreciate you taking the time to speak with me. Thanks very much for reading this project portfolio summary and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
